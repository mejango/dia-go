# Retained engineering lessons

- Detach mutable event metadata before callbacks; preserve pre-hash normalized bytes.
- Read-stream callbacks run once; retry only side-effect-free known-abort writes.
- A durable exact receipt can reconcile uncertainty; absence is not proof of rollback.
- Bind derived requests to immutable intent, including historical source versions.
- Freeze source before recording full verification; source mappings are not behavioral proof.
- One network is one signing trust domain. Delivery identity is distinct from store-peer identity.

## 2026-11-12: Framework consumers own their applications

The user rejected keeping Dia domain/runtime code in Toolbox. Treat Dia as an
independent third-party consumer: Toolbox must build and test without importing
Dia or owning Dia policies, models, routes, or entrypoints. A thin application
wrapper does not establish that boundary. Preserve capability grouping in Go
folders; enforce dependency direction with a repository check and test the
application against the public framework module, not only a sibling workspace.

## Paired configuration needs composition checks

Individually valid identity and document examples can still address different
identity stores or compete for the same publication queue. Verify the pair:
same physical database and trust, matching identity prefix, separate document
prefix and separate publication targets. A generic schema check alone cannot
prove these application relationships. deployment's paired-example regression
owns this check; never infer composition from four independent green configs.
