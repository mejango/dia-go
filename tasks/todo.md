# Standalone publication

## Plan refinement

- **Objective:** Publish the verified Go module and a separately buildable Dia application to the user-selected public repositories.
- **System fit:** Toolbox owns shared behavior and the Dia runtime package; dia-go owns an independent executable/configuration pinned to Toolbox. Existing JavaScript repositories remain references.
- **Reuse and simplicity:** Extract the existing Dia runtime without behavioral changes, use thin entrypoints, mechanically replace the module path, and adapt the existing CI to the repository root.
- **Evidence and unknowns:** Original verification and reviews are retained as historical evidence. Publication-specific checks cover extraction, module relocation and independent consumption; live cloud behavior remains unverified.
- **Verification:** Run package race/vet after extraction, full unit/race/vet after relocation, build containers, smoke the independent Dia entrypoint and verify exact public remote commits.
- **Resource budget:** Reuse installed dependencies and existing native fixtures; avoid domain duplication or a broad package split. Source publication is explicitly authorized, deployment is not.

- [x] Verify the standalone consumer against the published module.
- [ ] Push the consumer and verify its public remote identity.
